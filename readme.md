# What is this? 
Series of ansible playbooks to help in setting up Palo Alto firewalls. Coming from Palo Alto after learning other firewall vendors, I found the intial setup a little tedious just to get basic LAN + WAN + NAT + DHCP working, so I made this. 

# How to use
Follow the steps included to install Ansbile and required python packages, and pull down the basic_setup folder try it out on a factory reset (or fresh OOB) Palo Alto. Ran and tested against PA460's.
